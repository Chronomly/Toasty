This is a modified version of https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

I do not own, create, nor have any control over discord.py. It is only an API wrapper i use for Toasty. I have modified it to suit my needs and my modifications are NOT available online. Thus I am well within my rights under the MIT license
